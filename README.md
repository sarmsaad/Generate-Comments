# Generate-Comments

Generates clean comments from a csv file so that you can copy and paste immeadiately when the time comes and you have to enter the grades on Blackboard.

test.csv is how your csv file should look like:
1. the first row has the IDs of each cell.
2. the second row (perfect) contains the rubric of the perfect score. 

comments.txt is the generated file that's ready for pasting (demo)

Comments format:
Header: gives you the person's username and their final score.
Comments: self explanatory.
Footer: the name and email of the grader so they know who to contact.
